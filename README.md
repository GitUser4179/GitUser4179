Hello there I go by calm and I'm a fullstack developer within .NET. I am currently enrolled in Chasacademy and hope to create useful projects for both myself and my peers to use. My current goal is to create a file converter published to a fully working domain. I'd also like to create tools to ease in games such as collecting data.
